# OneTap Mobile

React Native + Expo mobile app for the OneTap secure file sharing platform.

## Features

- 🔐 **End-to-end encryption** — AES-256-GCM encryption happens on-device before upload
- 🔗 **One-time access links** — each link can only be used once
- ⏱️ **Custom expiry** — set links to expire in minutes, hours, or days
- 📁 **File support** — images, PDFs, text files
- 📋 **Copy to clipboard** — instantly copy generated links
- 📤 **Share files** — use native share sheet to open/share decrypted files
- 🌙 **Dark purple UI** — matches the design reference

## Screens

| Screen | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Splash** | Animated intro with progress bar |
| **Home** | Dashboard with cloud storage banner, file categories, recent files, and open-link modal |
| **Upload** | Pick a file, set expiry, encrypt & upload, copy the generated link |
| **View** | Paste a secure link or navigate from Home to decrypt and view a file |
| **About** | Team profiles with social links and feature list |

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Start the Expo development server
npx expo start
```

Then scan the QR code with **Expo Go** on your phone, or press:
- `a` — open Android emulator

## How Encryption Works

1. User picks a file on their device
2. File is read as an ArrayBuffer
3. A random AES-256-GCM key + IV are generated
4. File is encrypted in-memory
5. Encrypted bytes are written to a temp cache file
6. Temp file is uploaded to the server
7. The decryption key is embedded in the shareable link as a URL fragment (`#key=...`)
8. The server never sees the plaintext key — only the recipient with the full link can decrypt
